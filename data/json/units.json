      "content":"<b>P1.1: Define speed and calculate average speed.</b> Speed of an object is the distance it travels per unit time. We quantify this as the ratio of the distance it travels to the time taken to travel that distance.The formula for average speed is therefore Speed = Distance / Time (refer to the first photo). <b>P1.2: Distinguish between speed and velocity.</b> The basic difference between speed and velocity is that speed is a scalar quantity whereas velocity is a vector quantity. Vector quantities have magnitude and direction. Vector quantities can be negative in nature. For example: velocity can be -9 meters per second. Scalar quantities have magnitude but do not have a direction - making them an absolute value which implies that they cannot be negative. <b>P1.3 &amp; P1.4: Plot and interpret a speed/time graph and a distance/time graph. Recognise from the shape of a speed/time graph when a body is: At rest, moving with constant speed or moving with changing speed.</b> When plotting a graph we need to remember that time is always on the X-axis of the graph. On the Y-axis we have the speed or the distance according to the graph type you are plotting. A distance time graph looks like the one in the second picture. The gradient of a distance/time graph determines the speed of the object (because gradient is calculated by dividing change in y by change in x, this would mean that we're simply dividing the distance travelled by time taken). The steeper the line, the higher the speed. A speed/time graph looks like the one in the third picture. The gradient of this graph gives us the acceleration and the area under the curve gives us the distance travelled (because area is calculated by different formulas often involving multiplication of y and x variables which would mean that we're multiplying the speed and time to get the distance). <b>P1.5: Recognise linear motion for which the acceleration is constant and calculate the acceleration.</b> In the speed time graph if we look carefully acceleration is constant at the initial stage because the gradient is same, i.e. the graph is a straight line. Acceleration is given by the formula: Acceleration = Change In Speed / Time. <b>P1.6: Recognise motion for which the acceleration is not constant.</b> Previously we saw how acceleration was constant. However in real life acceleration is rarely constant! Tt is always changing. If the line of speed/time graph is not straight, i.e. the speed is not changing at a constant rate, the acceleration is changing too. If an object's speed per second is as follows: 5 kmph, 6 kmph, 7 kmph and 8 kmph, it isn't hard to grasp that the acceleration is constant because the increase in speed is happening at a constant rate. However, if the speed per second of an object is given as follows: 5 kmph, 6 kmph, 8 kmph, 15 kmph, 25 kmph and 10 kmph, it is easy to see that the points would not form a straight line and therefore the acceleration is not constant.  <b>P1.7: Calculate the area under a speed/time graph to work out the distance travelled for motion with constant acceleration.</b> As discussed before, when we calculate an area under a speed/time graph we get the distance traveled by the object. Let's try this by calculating the distance in the first 8 seconds (refer to the second image): So as we can see in the first 8 seconds the graph forms a triangle. We can use our basic mathematical skills to find the area of the triangle. Area of triangle = 0.5 x Base x Height. Thus area of triangle = 0.5 x 8 x 6.5 = 26 meters. So the distance traveled in the initial 8 seconds is 26 meters. <b>P1.8: Demonstrate a qualitative understanding that acceleration is related to changing speed.</b> Acceleration is the measure of the change of velocity of an object per unit time.",

        "content":"<b>P2.1: Difference between Mass and Weight.</b> Weight is the gravitational pull on an object measured in Newtons. Weight is different on different planets because of the varying gravity of different planets. Weight is mass multiplied by the gravitational force. Mass is the amount of matter in an object. The mass  of an object/substance is constant universally, i.e. it never changes - even if the gravitational pull changes. Newton  had three laws of motion, one of which was known as the law of intertia. Inertia states that &ldquo;A body at rest, remains at rest, and a body of motion, remains in motion at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.&rdquo; Inertia is a property of mass, which means that greater the mass, greater the opposition to change in velocity and therefore greater the intertia. Everything that has a mass has a gravitational field. However, on masses as small as the bodies around us, the gravitational field produced is trivial and often negligible. Large masses like planets and starts have a strong gravitational force which can be felt and observed by us easily. The bigger the planet is, i.e. the greater the mass, the larger the gravitational force created. Earth&rsquo;s gravitational force is about 9.8 N/kg, which means that if an object's mass is 1 kilogram, it exerts a force of 9.8 Newtons on the ground/surface of earth (or rather, the earth pulls it that hard). Note that it is worth considering that the gravitational acceleration can also be used to determine how fast an object would accelerate if it were to participate in a free fall. Newton's second law of motion, therefore, states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the amount of force applied on the object where the constant of proportionality is the mass of the object. If we were to formulate this into an equation, we would get F = m x a, where m is the mass, F is the force applied and a is the acceleration of the object. In the context of the gravitational force, therefore, we can say that the weight (W) is simply the mass times gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>). This can be given by the formula: W = m x g. ",
